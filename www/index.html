I'm Oakdale but my close friends call me Oakee, my brother calls me Oakhead and my mommie calls me Dale. Ya'll don't make me cry talking about my momma, I just started this story. I'm 23 years old and I'm from Houston Texas but i've been living in Portland Maine for the last seven months. Sometimes I say Portland "Mayne hold up" but people up here don't get it. Everyday I say I'm getting on a plane and never coming back. I mean they got crazy cheap deals on spirit airlines but some of them deals be too good to be true right? I work at Trader Joes 4 days a week in the evening and Hannaford Supermarket 5 days in the morning. but I do have 720 instagram followers. Don't be a hater because you stay on IG and you follow way more people than people who follow you and stay looking thirsty. I'm sorry we started off on the wrong foot. Anyways, &nbsp;I look forward to getting out of work early on friday and go walking in old port with Sparrow. Sparrow is my roommate and ex fiance's sister. It's alot to unpack I know. long story short, I moved to Portland after Victor, my ex proposed to me over the phone after about a year of dating long distance. Just know that Facetime isn't face to face and it's 6 other days in the week after he post you as his WCW. I digress. My mom didn't know I was engaged or in a serious relationship for that matter. She thinks I go to the University of Southern Maine, even though I never stepped foot on campus. Listen, I'm figuring it all out. Which brings me to Fort Bloom.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Bloom is a place where women ROAR!!! Just imagine me yelling that in the lunch room at work as I often do. Fort Bloom isn't a place but an idea. Come to think of it, I guess it could be a place. How much does a small town cost? Basically it's an idea for now, where women can thrive and overcome whatever challenges that they may face. Where women can make there dreams become reality. That's where you come in. I'm reaching out to people online to help me figure this all out. that includes you. Yes you reading this right now. My story is your story. &nbsp;You can contribute to the continuation of my life. that includes my friends and family. You can introduce new characters, and even choose were I decide to work and live in the future. You write the story. At the bottom there is a box where you can contribute. Once submitted, if your version of future events in the life of Oakdale is selected, it will be published to the storyline along with your name listed as the contributer. You can also submit drawings of characters or even short films of your version of events. &nbsp;There will also at times be alternate version of events that will be highlighted at the same time that will be put to a vote as the official version. Please allow you mind to wonder.&nbsp;</p></div>

                <p class="mbr-header__subtext"></p><p>By Amber Stanton posted December 12, 2017</p><br><br><p><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's FRIDAY!!! I'm late for work and I can't find my phone. Sparrow's trying to call it but that ain't gonna work because my phone died and she act like my charger is our charger.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">"Your gonna be late." Sparrow says. </span><span style="font-style: normal;">what time is it? "7:45" MANN!! I'm going to be late. Sparrow has a habit of looking for at least one I told you so a day. It's been that way ever since she told me not to date her brother and I thought she just didn't like me. Did I mention we're roommates? It was supposed to be a temporary situation until her brother and I got married. You would think it's ackward and it is. Suprisingly, we get along for the most part even though I know she looks at me like i'm some sad person for not just packing my bags and going back to Houston. </span></p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;"> I usually would ride my bike to work and bayside trail is so peaceful in the morning. My mom would kill me if I told her I ride my bike to work. Growing up in Houston you would look super extra on a bike or you're just from a somewhere else and you're trying not to conform to the fact that Houston is not an outdoor city.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;">I ask Sparrow for a ride. She agrees but not without the customary shade. "Sure girl but Imma need to borrow your bike later." I chuckle so to not make it ackward but it kills me that I have to ask for stuff. I work my butt off to try and be independent in a place I have no business in but I always end up needing something from her. I feel like that's the reason she just takes my charger as if, how can I dare say something since I need so much. I'm trying not to blow up behind a charger though. We've been pretty good so far. I get in the car and were bumping SZA ofcourse.&nbsp;</span><br><br>"How you ain't say you was movin' forward?
<br>Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
<br>I gotta say I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
<br>Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
<br>Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
<br>How you lead me out so far away?<br><br>How could it be?
<br>20 something, all alone still
<br>Not a thing in my name
<br>Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
<br>Only know fear
<br>That's me, Ms. 20 Something
<br>Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
<br>Wish you were here, oh"<br><br><p><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I'm getting all in my feelings and I can see Sparrow gearing up to ask me something personal about me and Victor's past relationship. This wasn't unlike her but some how it still caught me off guard. Girl you know Kaio told me how he wasn't attracted to you after you moved here and I told him he was crazy ...<p><iframe src="assets/images/ezgif-5-db0184ff44.gif" width="280" height="70" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" ></iframe><p><a href="assets/images/ezgif-5-db0184ff44.gif"></a></p><br><br><p></p>
